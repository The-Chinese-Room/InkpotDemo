        This is a demo of some of the types of interaction between Ink script and the game world.
        The Ink flow is controlled by triggers that have been setup in the level blueprint.  
        Use W,A,S,D to walk, and the left and right arrow keys to turn.
        Now, walk towards to the colourless cubes.
    - not (visited has RedRoundel or visited has BlueBox ):
        Visit the blue box or the red roundel areas.
    - not ( visited has BlueBox ):
        -> FlowDescription ->
        Check out the blue box.
    - not ( visited has RedRoundel ):
        -> FlowDescription ->
        Now, go visit out the red roundel.
    - visited has (RedRoundel, BlueBox) and not ( visited has Parms ) and Main >= 7:
        Ok, enough of facts about red and blue!
        Walk over to the parameter passing pad, 
        and see how easy it is to pass parameters to Ink.
    - Main < 7:
        { shuffle :
        - See the blue box again.
        - Regard the red roundel once more.
        }
    - else :
        { shuffle :
        - Change the colour of the cubes, again.
        - Go back to the blue box.
        - Return to the red roundel.
        }
    }

= FlowDescription
    { not( visited ? FlowsExplained ):
        The Red Roundel and the Blue Box show how flows can switch and continue from where they left off. 
        Walking into either colour area will switch the flow and continue the Ink script for red or blue. 
        Leaving the area will pause the script for that flow.

        These cubes demo how you can react to an Ink variable changing its value. 
        For these cubes, we are waiting for the Ink variable 'CubeColour' to change.
        Check the details panel for the cube to see this, under Inkpot Watch.
        Open the blueprint, props\\BP_InkyCube, to see how this is setup using an Inkpot watch component.
        Now, these cubes have no colour! 
        What colour should they be?
    - else :
        The cubes are {CubeColour}, what new colour should they be?
    }

    +[Red] You chose Red.
        ~CubeColour = Red
    +[Blue] Blue is the choice you made. 
        ~CubeColour =Blue
    +[Green] Green, green, green, it's not easy bein’ green!
        ~CubeColour = Green
    - The cubes are now {CubeColour}
    Now go check out some of the other areas.
    When you come back here you can change the cube colour again.
